# Ok Zoomer

Ok Zoomer is a mod that adds a highly configurable zoom packed with tons of features!

By default, a unique take on zooming is provided, however, by configuring this mod through Mod Menu or a file, the zoom can be adapted for your own purposes! Here's an example: want a cinematic camera while zooming? Enable it! Want to have a better control over it? Toggle it to the Multiplied mode and adjust the multiplier! Do you hate it but still want some grip on the zoom? Enable "Reduce Sensitivity"! On this mod, you are in charge of the zoom!
